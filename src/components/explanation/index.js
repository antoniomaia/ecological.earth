        When talking about climate change, <em>footprint</em> is a metaphor for
        the total impact that something has. And <em>carbon</em> is a shorthand
        for all the different greenhouse gases that contribue to global warming.
        <br />
        <br />
        The term <em>carbon footprint</em>, therefore, is a shorthand to
        describe the best estimate that we can get of the full climate change
        impact of something. That something could be anything â€“ an activity, an
        item, a lifestyle, a company, a country or even the whole world.
